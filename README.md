# Python Crash Course 3rd Edition

With my attempt to brush up and hone my skills in python, I decided to use this book, [Python Crash Course 3rd Edition](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition), as a linear guide to reach that goal. In this repo, I will be posting my own written solutions of  exercises that are present in this book. From brushing up my python scripting skills to learning new coding conventions, I plan to attempt various projects offered in this book as well. Projects I am interested in include data visualization (chapters 15, 16, & 17), as well as web applications (chapters 18, 19, 20). The web application section coincides nicely with one of my current courses, CMPUT404 - Web Applications & Architecture. 

I will be doing this on a daily basis, with a goal to finish as soon as possible. I am excited to *git add* all of these skills to my arsenal, to *git commit* and stay consistent as I progress through this journey, and to *git push* beyond my limits.
